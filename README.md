# Brain Modeling with The Virtual Brain (TVB)

This project uses **The Virtual Brain (TVB)** Python library to simulate large-scale brain dynamics. It explores how brain activity evolves under different conditions, such as resting state and stimulation.

## Features
- Neural mass model simulations using TVB
- Functional connectivity and time-series analysis
- Machine learning for analyzing brain state transitions
- Visualizations of brain signals and model outputs

## Main Tools & Libraries
- Python
- The Virtual Brain (TVB)
- NumPy, Matplotlib

## Purpose
This is a university project for exploring computational modeling of the brain.

## Running
You can run the cells of the notebook.
